# The Saturday Sessions

Welcome to the The Saturday Sessions, a collection of tutorials and resources designed to
provide exposure to equity-seeking students as part of the Open Seeds Cohort and Digital Research Alliance EDIA
Champions Program.

This guide is intended to lower the barrier to entry so that you can submit your first working jobs
in a variety of fields with minimal tweaks.

## ðŸŒŸ Highlights ðŸŒŸ

This guide has several valuable resources to help you get up to speed:

- **Software Pages**: introductions to the various tools referenced in this documentation

- **Tutorials**: walkthroughs for several common workflows/softwares

- **Sample Scripts**: example Python and SLURM scripts

## Prerequisites

- **Set up your local machine**: this guide assumes that your local machine
  is setup up with the necessary software already installed (e.g., Hatch, Python, etc.)

- **Set up your cluster account**: some of the tutorials in the guide
  require that you connect to the remote clusters provided by the Alliance. For these
  tutorials, you will need a valid CCDB account and to set up your remote cluster environment.
