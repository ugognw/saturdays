## Digital Research Alliance (formerly Compute Canada)

[Documentation][dra]

This is the national organization that manages our main computational resources.
Their documentation is comprehensive, including details about specific
[clusters][clusters], [available software][software], and [how to get started][get-started].
To use these resources, [you'll need to create a CCDB account](tutorials/ccdb.md).

- [Transferring data to remote clusters](tutorials/data_transfer.md)

## Slurm Workload Manager

[Documentation][slurm]

Slurm is the job scheduler that runs on our remote clusters. You can find a useful
cheatsheet [here][slurm-cheatsheet]. `sbatch`, `squeue`, and `sacct` are commonly
used for submitting and monitoring jobs.

## bash

[Documentation][bash]

bash is a shell program and shell-scripting language. Notably, it is the default
on most compute clusters. Navigating and interacting with the file system on remote
clusters is done using bash. For example, the command-line functions `ssh` and `scp`
are used to connect to and transfer files between the Alliance clusters.

## Git

[Documentation][git]

Git is a version control system (VCS) that allows you to keep track of multiple versions
of files at once. With git it's easy to revert back to an old version of a file or merge
different versions of files. This is very helpful when you're trying to determine what
change resulted in a particular error. Chapters 1 to 3 provide a good
enough background to get started. See Section 5.1 for a description of
our git workflow, the ["Integration-Manager Workflow"][git-workflow].
You can find a guide to git best practices [here][git-best-practices].

## Python

[Documentation][python]

Python is a relevant programming language in which many useful utilities for our
computational workflows are written. Python files can be identified by the `.py` extension.

## Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)

[Documentation][ase]

The Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) is a set of tools and Python modules for
setting up, manipulating, running, visualizing and analyzing atomistic simulations.

## Pymatgen

[Documentation][pymatgen]

Pymatgen (Python Materials Genomics) is an open-source Python library for materials analysis.

## cclib

[Documentation][cclib]

cclib is an open source library, written in Python, for parsing and interpreting the results
of computational chemistry packages.

## Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP)

[Documentation][vasp]

VASP is a proprietary, plane-wave-based code used for studying periodic systems.

## Quantum Espresso

[Documentation][espresso]

From their webpage:

> Quantum Espresso is an integrated suite of Open-Source computer codes for electronic-structure
> calculations and materials modeling at the nanoscale. It is based on density-functional theory,
> plane waves, and pseudopotentials.

## Gaussian

[Documentation][gaussian]

Gaussian is a proprietary, gaussian-orbital based code mainly used for studying
molecular systems. The Alliance also maintains a [documentation page][alliance-gaussian]
for running Gaussian on Alliance clusters.

## ORCA

[Documentation][orca]

ORCA is a free-for-academic gaussian-orbital based code mainly used for studying
molecular systems.

## Markdown

[Documentation][markdown]

Markdown is a markup language commonly used for writing documentation. A common extension
for Markdown files is `.md`. The documentation for this Welcome Guide is written in
Markdown. Markdown files can easily be converted into the pages of a static website using
a tool like [mkdocs][mkdocs].

## Lmod

[Documentation][lmod]

Lmod is a software for managing software environments. The necessary commands
and variables required for a software to be used are specified in 'module files'
that are written in the [Lua programming language][lua]. Modules are managed using
commands like `module load`, `module purge`, and `module unload`.

## **Comp**utational **Chem**istry **Util**itie**s**

[Documentation][ccu]

CompChemUtils (Computational Chemistry Utilities; AKA `ccu`) is a Python package
containing several useful Python classes and routines for computational
chemistry such as adsorbate complex creation, defect creation, free energy
diagram generation, and more.

## Autojob

[Documentation][autojob]

`autojob` is a framework for executing high throughput calculations with the
flexibility to granularly resubmit and modifying calculations between
execution. Autojob also provides a codeless interface for generating input
directories for calculations.
